```
In the first line where cd has no arguments, the directory was home and the command "cd" changes the directory to home
so there are no changes.  Therefore, there is no error when cd is typed out.
In the second line where cd has the argument "lecture1/", it was ran in the home directory.  Additionally, the
directory was changed to lecture1 because the command cd followed by the argument "lecture1/" causes
the directory to be changed to lecture1.  There are no errors in this output.
In the third line where cd's argument is a file name called "README", it was ran in the lecture1 directory.  The
output was an error because the cd tried to change the directory to a file.  The file is not considered a
directory, so an error was created.
