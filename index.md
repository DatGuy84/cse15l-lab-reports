## CD

```
In the first line where cd has no arguments, the directory was home. The command "cd" changes the directory to home,
and since the directory was already at home, there were no changes.  Therefore, there is no error when cd is typed out.

```
This code was ran in the home directory.  Additionally, the directory was changed to lecture1 because the command cd
followed by the argument "lecture1/" causes the directory to be changed to lecture1.  There are no errors in this output.

```
This code was ran in the lecture1 directory.  The output was an error because the cd tried to change the directory to a file.
The file is not considered a directory, so an error was created.
